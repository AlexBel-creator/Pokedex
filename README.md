# Pokedex - PokedexAPI

![Thumbnail](./pokedex-react/src/assets/Thumbnail.jpg)


It's a peer programming project üë•

The `apiRest.js` file, which includes calls to the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2), doesn't contain any sensitive data. It's designed to fetch public Pok√©mon data, so there's no need to add this file to `.gitignore`.


## Features

- Browse a list of Pok√©mon
- View detailed information about each Pok√©mon
- Responsive and user-friendly interface


## Stack: React + Vite 

This project is a Pokedex application built using React and Vite. It offers a streamlined setup to utilize React efficiently with Vite's capabilities, including HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and ESLint configurations for code quality.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
